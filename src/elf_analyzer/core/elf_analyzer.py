    # - rework naming convention. Make a clear distinction between domains in
    # the bifurcation graph vs. assigned features
    # - Update Analyzer to include more convenience methods
    # - add a method to print a more traditional bifurcation plot
    # - create method to get all radii around each atom using new radii method:
        # 1. get atom neighbors (up to distance or dynamically)
        # 2. find radii for closest and add to official neighbors
        # 3. go to next closest and get radii. See if they fit under planes made
        # by other radii
        # 4. Continue until all neighbors found. (Whats the best stop condition?)
    # - rework BadELF voxel assignment using Numba. That should just be so much
    # faster. I could probably even reimplement exact voxel splitting
    # - Update simmate workflows (and badelf -_- )
